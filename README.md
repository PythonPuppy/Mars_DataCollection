# Mars_DataCollection
This assignment consists of two technical products. 
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Using Beautiful Soup object  extract text elements from the website.
Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview.
Store it in a list

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the column headings:

id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
ls: the solar longitude
month: the Martian month
min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location


To analyze dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

How many months exist on Mars?
How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
Export the DataFrame to a CSV file
